# Project Overview
Amazing Prime is hosting a hackathon event where teams of analysts collaborate to work intensively on a project, using data to solve a problem. Data gathered from Wikipedia and Kaggle must be cleaned and combined into a SQL database for the hackathon participants to access. This will be accomplished by creating an automated pipeline  to preform the ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database. The following items will be created:

    1. Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
    2. Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
    3. Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
    4. Create the Movie Database
